# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

This project tackles a multi-step form process primarily using React and Redux. Feedback is collected over four views with a separate review page to display the current feedback. The submit button will submit the data to your local database.

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
