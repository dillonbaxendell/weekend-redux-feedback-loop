# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

The goal of this project was to produce a multi-step form using React and Redux that allows users to leave feedback for the day. Feedback is collected over 4 views with the input data displayed in a separate Review page. Upon submission, the data is stored in the local database.

The user also has the option to go to the NEXT page or go back one page using the GO BACK button. Some other features include: 
- Input validation (user must enter a number 0-5 on required fields)
- An `Admin` page that displays all of the feedback in a table to review the data.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
